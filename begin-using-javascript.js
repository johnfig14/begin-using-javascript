//1. create and load a JavaScript file into an execution environment such as Node or a browser
    //This exercise asserts this point of being able to load a Javascript (.js) file into an execution environment (deployment/hosting).


//2. turn on strict mode and explain why it is better for scope reasons
    //Strict mode enforces declaring variables - that's why forgetting to declare variables deep in the code can result in the creation of a global variable.


//3. find their way around proper (e.g. MDN) documentation
    /*Navigate to the following site: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
    Alternatively, search in a search engine for specific terms in which to find what your looking for:
    Ex. output results using alert() and console.log() javascript MDN.


//4. comment individual and block comments
    //This line is an example of a commented line of code in JavaScript.
    /* This block of code is
    an example of commented-
    out code, or, in other
    words, a block comment.
    */ 


//5. demonstrate how to output results using alert() and console.log() to assist with debugging
    //Example of using alert() to make sure information comes through to the user:
        windows.alert("I like cheese!");

    //Example of using console.log() - a method in which to display data.
        const apple = "A fruit";
        console.log(apple);

//6. declare and initialize variables
    //Example of declaring and initializing a variable:
        const firstname = "",
            lastName = "",
            price = 0,
            discount = 0,
            fullPrice = 0,
            myArray = [],
            myObject = {};


//7. demonstrate understanding of "operators" concept
    //Some arithmatic operators:
        var = 1 + 2;
        var = 2 - 1;
        var = 2 * 5;
        var = 10 / 5;
    //Some assignment operators:
        var x = y;
        var x += y;


//8. perform simple tasks using operators and assign the results to variables
    //Example of the above-mentioned task:
        var x = 3;
        var y = 6;
        var z = x + y;
        console.log(z);
